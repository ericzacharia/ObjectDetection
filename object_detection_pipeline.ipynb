        "\n",
        "**this is not correct. SAM is not multimodal. MULTIMODAL**: SAM is a multimodal model, which means it can accept multiple types of input. In this case, SAM accepts both images and text captions as input. SAM will use its LLM capabilities to understand the text captions and segment the images.\n",
        "\n",
        "**WHY SAM?**: Before the release of multimodal models, computer vision experts would have to manully annotate thousands of images with special care for their deep learning models. This involved drawing boxes around pixels of interest, being careful to all of the pixels that include the object of interest while minimizing the amount of pixels in the background. Special considerations also needed to be made for objects of interest that appeared partially out of frame and for partially occluded objects of interest in the image. Each carefully drawn bounding polygon is then labeled from the set of classifications that you are hoping to train the target model to detect. This labor intensive process used to be a major obstacle for custom object detection models, and it is something I've had the pleasure of doing as recently as March of 2023, which was the release date of Meta's SAM. So to save time and moeny, we will use SAM as a Base Model to help create a labeled dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**ONTOLOGY**: An Ontology defines how your Base Model is prompted, what your Dataset will describe, and what your Target Model will predict. A simple Ontology is the CaptionOntology which prompts a Base Model with text captions and maps them to class names. Other Ontologies may, for instance, use a CLIP vector or example images instead of a text caption.\n",
        "\n",
        "**BASE MODEL**: A Base Model is a large foundation model that knows a lot about a lot. Base models are often multimodal and can perform many tasks. They're large, slow, and expensive. Examples of Base Models are Meta's SAM and OpenAI's GPT-4 multimodal variant.\n",
        "\n",
        "**LABELED DATASET**: The output from the Base Model is a labeled dataset, which is a set of auto-labeled images. First we'll review the data for mistakes; we can delete incorrectly labeled images from the dataset or we can use an annotation tool to edit the labels. Examples of annotation tools include: LabelMe, LabelImg, CVAT, SuperAnnotate, ScaleAI, Roboflow Annotator, and many more. \n",
        "\n",
        "**TARGET MODEL**: A Target Model is a model that is trained on a labeled dataset to perform a specific task. Target Models are often small, fast, cheap, and fine-tuned to perform a specific task very well, but they don't generalize well beyond the information described in their dataset. Examples of Target Models are YOLO and DETR. Once we have corrected all mistakes in our labeled dataset, then it is safe to proceed with training our Target Model - in this case YOLOv8."
